Studies in twins have shown that genetics account for approximately a third to 50 percent of the variation of someone’s happiness.\nThe research has been published in the Journal of Human Genetics.", "title": "Happiness gene is revealed", "source_url": "https://www.healthcareglobal.com/hospitals/happiness-gene-revealed", "source": "Healthcare Global", "post_time": {"time_ts": 1305734400000, "time_trust_code": 7}, "subtitle": " Scientists have found that our happiness is down to not only how well our lives are going, but also a ‘happiness gene.\tIt is thought that the 5-H...", "authors": ["Admin "], "channels": ["Hospitals"]}
