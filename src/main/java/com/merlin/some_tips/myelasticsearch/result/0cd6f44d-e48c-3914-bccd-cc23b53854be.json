The acquisition demonstrates the growing importance of Nuclear Medicine as a novel treatment approach in the Oncology space, and will enable AAA to advance its oncology theragnostic platform. Additionally, it will allow Novartis to further its ambitions to treat diseases, such as cancers through utilising AAA’s personalised tools and technologies.\nMr. Stefano Buono, Chief Executive Officer of AAA has said, “It is with great satisfaction that we announce this proposed transaction with Novartis, who we have long felt would be an ideal partner to enhance the launch of lutetium Lu 177 dotatate* (Lutathera) for neuroendocrine tumours (NETs).”\nRelated stories\nMental health is having a severe impact on employment figures\nLeading medtech company breaks ground on manufacturing site expansion in Nebraska\nFDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb releases statement regarding medical device innovation\n“We believe that the combination of our expertise in radiopharmaceuticals and theragnostic strategy together with the global oncology experience and infrastructure of Novartis, provide the best prospects for our patients, physicians and employees, as well as the broader nuclear medicine community.”\nThe company recently received European approval surrounding the marketing authorisation for Lutathera in September, and is currently under review by the Food & Drug Administration.\n“Novartis has a strong legacy in the development and commercialisation of medicines for neuroendocrine tumours where significant unmet need remains for patients,” commented Bruno Strigini, Head of Novartis Oncology.\nThe growth of Novartis in this area is in stark contrast to its generics division. The company is set to cut over 400 jobs within its Colorado manufacturing plant as a result of growing price pressures within the pharmaceutical market, against a battle to remain competitive against new and similar players.", "title": "Novartis has signed a $3.9 billion MOU with Advanced Accelerator Applications", "source_url": "https://www.healthcareglobal.com/medical-devices-and-pharma/novartis-has-signed-dollar39-billion-mou-advanced-accelerator-applications", "source": "Healthcare Global", "post_time": {"time_ts": 1509292800000, "time_trust_code": 7}, "subtitle": "It has recently been announced that radiopharmaceutical giant Advanced Accelerator Applications (AAA) has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) wit...", "authors": ["Catherine Sturman"], "channels": ["Medical Devices & Pharma"]}
