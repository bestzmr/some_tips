Revenues increased by 31.7% YoY to RMB334.7 million ($48.1 million) in the third quarter of fiscal 2020. The increase was mainly driven by the implementation of a new processing fee in April 2019 as well as growth in the Company's total subscriber base.\nThe Company recruited 23,387 new subscribers during the reporting quarter. Revenues generated from processing fees and other services increased by 38.9% YoY to RMB218.5 million ($31.4 million).

Operating income for the reporting quarter increased by 65.1% YoY to RMB152.9 million ($22.0 million), mainly driven by margin expansion as a result of new processing pricing and steady storage revenue growth.

In the third quarter, the Company recognized an increase in fair value of equity securities, or \"mark-to-market gain,\" of RMB8.0 million ($1.2 million) compared to the mark-to-market loss of RMB28.4 million in the prior year period.

According to the letter, Cordlife would issue approximately 2,497.9 million ordinary shares at an issue price of SGD0.5 per ordinary share in exchange for all of the outstanding ordinary shares of the Company at $7.50 per ordinary share. Upon completion of the proposed transaction, the Company's ordinary shares would be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, and Cordlife ordinary shares would continue to trade on the SGX. On June 5, 2019, the Board formed a special committee of independent directors (the \"Special Committee\") who are not affiliated with Cordlife to evaluate such proposal.  On November 11, 2019, the Company appointed Mr. Jack Chow as an independent non-executive director (\"INED\") of the Board. Mr. Chow has extensive professional experience and a broad network in the finance and investment industry. He replaced Mr. Mark Chen as a member of the Audit Committee and Ms. Jennifer Weng as a member of the Special Committee. Mr. Chow also joined the Board's Compensation Committee and Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee.   On February 6, 2020, the Company appointed Mr. Jacky Cheng as an INED of the Board. Mr. Cheng has extensive professional experience and knowledge in legal and compliance and Chinese laws. He joined the Board's Compensation Committee as a member and the Company's Special Committee as a member. Currently, the Special Committee is composed of four members, including Mr. Mark Chen, Dr. Ken Lu, Mr. Jack Chow, and Mr. Jacky Cheng.  \nThe Company cautions its shareholders and others considering trading its ordinary shares that no decisions have been made with respect to the Company's response to the proposed transaction with Cordlife. The proposed transaction is still subject to various conditions, including but not limited to, completion of due diligence, parties entering into a definitive agreement, and/or each of Cordlife and the Company obtaining its relevant regulatory and shareholder approvals. In addition, litigation has been filed in the Cayman Islands challenging the proposed transaction. There can be no assurance that any definitive offer will be made, that any agreement will be executed, or that this or any other transaction will be approved or consummated.\nConference Call\nThe Company will host a conference call at 8:00 a.m. ET on Thursday, March 12, 2020, to discuss its financial performance and give a brief overview of the Company's recent developments, followed by a question and answer session. Interested parties can access the audio webcast through the Company's IR website at http://ir.globalcordbloodcorp.com. A replay of the webcast will be accessible two hours after the conference call and available for seven days at the same URL above. Listeners can also access the call by dialing 1-646-722-4977 or 1-855-824-5644 for US callers, or +852-3027-6500 for Hong Kong callers, access code: 66192143#.\n[1] During the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2019, 23,387 and 65,753 new subscribers were recruited, respectively. The Company reclassified 199 and 1,026 private cord blood units as donated cord blood units during the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2019, respectively, after the Company determined that the recoverability of these prior private cord blood banking subscribers was remote. Therefore, the Company terminated their subscription services according to the subscription contracts and these units are being treated as if they were donated cord blood units and will be part of the Company's non-current inventories. Hence, the net accumulated subscriber base was 815,000 as of December 31, 2019.\n[2] See exhibit 3 to this press release for a reconciliation of non-GAAP operating income to exclude the non-cash items related to the depreciation and amortization expenses to the comparable financial measure prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"U.S. GAAP\"). \n[3] The reported operating income for the three months ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 included depreciation and amortization expenses related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of RMB12.7 million and RMB12.1 million ($1.7 million), respectively. The reported operating income for the nine months ended December 31, 2018 and 2019 included depreciation and amortization expenses related to property, plant and equipment and intangible assets of RMB39.3 million and RMB37.0 million ($5.3 million), respectively.\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nGAAP results for the three months and nine months ended December 31, 2019, include non-cash items related to depreciation and amortization expenses. To supplement the Company's unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements presented on a U.S. GAAP basis, the Company has provided adjusted financial information excluding the impact of these items in this press release. The non-GAAP financial measure represents non-GAAP operating income. Such adjustment is a departure of U.S. GAAP; however, the Company's management believes that these adjusted measures provide investors with a better understanding of how the results relate to the Company's historical performance. Also, management uses non-GAAP operating income as a measurement tool for evaluating actual operating performance compared to budget and prior periods. These adjusted measures should not be considered an alternative to operating income, or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures are not necessarily comparable to a similarly titled measure of another company. A reconciliation of the adjustments to U.S. GAAP results appears in exhibit 3 accompanying this press release. This additional adjusted information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for U.S. GAAP financials. The adjusted financial information that the Company provides also may differ from the adjusted information provided by other companies.\nAbout Global Cord Blood Corporation\nGlobal Cord Blood Corporation is the first and largest umbilical cord blood banking operator in China in terms of geographical coverage and the only cord blood banking operator with multiple licenses.
