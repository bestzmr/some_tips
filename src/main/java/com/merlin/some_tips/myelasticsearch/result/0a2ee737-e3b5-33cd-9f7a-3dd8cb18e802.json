The study was led by Dr. Lisa Smithers, a Public Health researcher at the University of Adelaide. She examined the link between the eating habits of children at 6 months, 15 months and 2 years and their IQ at 8 years of age.\nThe study compared a range of dietary patterns in more than 7,000 children that included home-made food, junk foods, breast feeding, and ready-made baby foods.\nThe results indicated that children who were breast fed at six months and had a healthy diet on regular basis as also foods like legumes, cheese, fruit and vegetables at 15 and 24 months had an IQ up 2 points higher by age 8.\nThe study also found some negative effect on the IQ from the ready-prepared baby foods given at 6 months and some positive associations when given at 24 months.\nDr. Smithers said, “Those children who had diet regularly including biscuits, chocolates, sweets, soft drinks and chips in the first 2 years of their lives had IQs up to 2 points  lower by age 8.\nThis study reinforces the need to provide kids with healthy diets at a crucial, formative time in their lives.\nDr. Lisa said, “While the differences in IQ are not huge, this study provides some of the strongest evidence to date that dietary patterns from 6 to 24 months have a small but a larger impact on IQ at the age of 8. \"", "title": "Study says children following healthy diets have higher IQs", "source_url": "https://www.healthcareglobal.com/procurement-and-supply-chain/study-says-children-following-healthy-diets-have-higher-iqs", "source": "Healthcare Global", "post_time": {"time_ts": 1344528000000, "time_trust_code": 7}, "subtitle": " Children who eat healthy food have a higher IQ compared with those children who eat a lot of junk food says a new research from the University of Adela...", "authors": ["Admin "], "channels": ["Procurement & Supply Chain"]}
