The most common causes of medical errors include miscommunication among healthcare professionals, miscommunication between medical professionals and patients, misdiagnosis, complicated healthcare technologies, bad hospital systems, inexperienced and incompetent staff, unfamiliarity with medication names and abbreviations, and stress and fatigue.\nWhat Hospitals Can Do to Prevent Medical Errors\nWith due understanding of the potential dangers posed by medical errors, many hospitals are seeking to adopt new healthcare technologies to minimize errors.\nOne of these technologies is the computerized physician order entry, or CPOE. With this system in place, physicians will enter orders for their patients on a computer, which contains information such as the patients' clinical conditions, allergies and key lab values. The computer will then evaluate the safety of the orders and send them to the pharmacy.\nAccording to research, hospitals that implement CPOE can reduce their errors by up to 85 percent.\nHospitals can also reduce medical errors by implementing procedures and policies that can improve the delivery and efficiency of healthcare services.\nThey should make sure that all their employees have a clear understanding of the procedures and policies, as well as their roles and responsibilities. Some hospitals have online dashboards that display their readmission, infection, and surgical complication and error rates to the public.\nTo avoid turning potential customers away, they have to make an extra effort to keep their error rates low. Surgical errors can have drastic consequences, and hospitals can minimize such errors by introducing surgical checklists and instructing their surgeons to refer to them every time they perform a surgery.\nMost medical errors can be prevented, and hospitals can save many lives by making a greater commitment to reduce their errors.\nAbout the Author\nJohn McMalcolm is a freelance writer who writes on a wide range of subjects, from hospital management to office furniture.", "title": "Addressing the problem of Hospital Error", "source_url": "https://www.healthcareglobal.com/hospitals/addressing-problem-hospital-error", "source": "Healthcare Global", "post_time": {"time_ts": 1382025600000, "time_trust_code": 7}, "subtitle": " Written by John McMalcolm Medical errors occur more frequently than we think.\tWhile some of these errors only cause mild discomfort or illnesses, othe...", "authors": ["Admin "], "channels": ["Hospitals"]}
