Their brain scans were compared and it was this comparison that highlighted the damaged to the brain’s white matter.\nInternet addiction disorder (IAD) has only been recently been recognised as a medical condition and is typically classified as someone spending an excessive amount of time online, so much so it affects the day-to-day activities of their lives.\nDistress is also another symptom of IAD, as are involuntary typing motions, both of which occur when addicts are prevented from going online.\nThe findings have been published in the Plos One journal.\nWriting in the publication, the researchers said: “Overall, our findings indicate that IAD has abnormal white matter integrity in brain regions involving emotional generation and processing, executive attention, decision making and cognitive control.\n“The results also suggest that IAD may share psychological and neural mechanisms with other types of substance addiction and impulse control disorders.”\nAlso commenting on the research, Dr Henrietta Bowden-Jones, a consultant psychiatrist based at Imperial College London, said: “This type of research exploring the differences between normal brains and brains of people who suffer from internet addictions is groundbreaking as it makes clear neuroimaging links between internet addiction and other addictions such as alcohol, cocaine and cannabis amongst others.'\n“It is.. possible to consider this study as one of the seminal papers in determining how future generations of clinicians will view internet addiction,” she added.\nThere are now calls for more research and further investigations to be carried out into the effects of IAD.\nThe Healthcare Global magazine is now available on the iPad.
