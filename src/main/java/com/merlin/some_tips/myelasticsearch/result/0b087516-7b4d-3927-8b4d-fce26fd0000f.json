{"tags": "", "content": "SINGAPORE, June 22, 2020 /PRNewswire/ -- Holmusk is now offering a new coaching programme in Singapore which reaches out to severely overweight children, youths and parents in a convenient manner using a non face-to-face approach and guides them to make healthy lifestyle changes. This leverages Holmusk's technology to improve outcomes in a scalable and effective manner for the younger population.\nSeverely overweight children and youths are at risk of developing chronic metabolic diseases in adulthood. Positive lifestyle habits, such as having a healthy diet and participating in regular physical activity, can reduce these risks significantly.\nThis programme is targeted at children and youths who are severely overweight and/or have abnormal health screening results, such as elevated blood pressure or abnormal cholesterol levels. It aims to empower these children, youths and their parents with the knowledge and skills to improve their weight status and/or health outcomes. It is delivered via three monthly phone calls with a highly qualified health coach and Holmusk's proprietary mobile app, GlycoLeap. GlycoLeap is powered by a scalable digital therapeutics platform developed and tested by Holmusk over the past four years. It features photo-based food logging with dietary feedback and personalised coaching via the app to drive positive and sustainable behaviour changes.\n\"There is a powerful opportunity here to instil in children, youths and parents the decision-making capacity for a healthy lifestyle. We are delighted to be able to bring Holmusk's capabilities in technology and health delivery to such meaningful use,\" said Dr Yau Teng Yan, Chief Medical Officer at Holmusk. \"Together we can make a big difference in the health of our future generation in Singapore.\"\nHolmusk has already partnered with insurance companies, large corporate employers and pharmaceutical companies to improve the health of their employees and customers using GlycoLeap. For the next three years, Holmusk will be working with Singapore's Health Promotion Board to offer the phone coaching programme to children and youths who are severely overweight and/or have abnormal health screening results.\nAbout Holmusk\nHolmusk is a healthcare technology company on a mission to transform the lives of people with behavioural health and chronic diseases through evidence driven medicine.
