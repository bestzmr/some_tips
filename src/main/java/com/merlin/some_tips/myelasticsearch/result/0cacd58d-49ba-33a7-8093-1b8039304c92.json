In 2040, 23% older people will have had a cancer diagnosis in 2040, which is almost double the proportion in 2010, said the new Macmillan-funded research by King’s College London.\nThis is nearly four times the proportion for people between 45 and 64. Meanwhile, the lung cancer occurrences in the older women will more than double from in 2010 to 2040.\nThe research also said the prevalence of lung cancer in older men is expected to decrease. According to the research, the sharp rise cancer prevalence is likely to be due to reasons like the increasing incidence and increasing cancer survival and ageing population.\nProfessor Henrik Moller, one of the study authors at King’s College London says, “The research shows that large increase can be expected in the oldest age groups in the coming decades and with this the rising demand on the health services.”\nThe research also states, older cancer patients face many barriers to get the best care and treatment.\nMacmillan Cancer Support is the largest British charities. It provides specialist health care information and financial support to the people suffering from cancer. The British charity supports cancer support groups, local information and support centres and also helps with practical, medical, financial and emotional support.", "title": "Older people suffering from cancer to treble by 2040", "source_url": "https://www.healthcareglobal.com/procurement-and-supply-chain/older-people-suffering-cancer-treble-2040", "source": "Healthcare Global", "post_time": {"time_ts": 1346256000000, "time_trust_code": 7}, "subtitle": " Macmillan Cancer Support states that the number of older people living with cancer will treble by 2040 from 1.3 million in 2010 to 4.1 million.
