The increase in total revenues was driven primarily by sales of Natera's Panorama and Horizon tests.

Despite selling its Evercord business in the third quarter of 2019, Natera achieved an overall increase of approximately 20% for the quarter.\nTotal revenues for 2019 were $302.3 million compared to $257.7 million in 2018, which represents an increase of 17%. In 2019, Natera processed approximately 804,300 tests including approximately 753,800 tests accessioned in its laboratory, compared to approximately 668,600 tests processed in 2018, including approximately 625,900 tests accessioned in its laboratory.

The increase was driven primarily by higher personnel-related expenses resulting from an increase in commercial activities and an increase in research and development activities under strategic partnerships. Total operating expenses, net of gain from the disposal of the Evercord business of $14.4 million in the year ended December 31, 2019 were $243.1 million, an increase of approximately 18% compared to $206.2 million in the same period of the prior year.

Subsequent events may cause these expectations to change, and Natera disclaims any obligation to update the forward-looking statements in the future.\nThese forward-looking statements are subject to known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially, including: we face numerous uncertainties and challenges in achieving the financial guidance provided; we may be unable to further increase the use and adoption of Panorama and Horizon, through our direct sales efforts or through our laboratory partners, or to develop and successfully commercialize new products, including Signatera and Prospera; we have incurred losses since our inception and we anticipate that we will continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future; our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period; our estimates of market opportunity and forecasts of market growth may prove to be inaccurate; we may be unable to compete successfully with existing or future products or services offered by our competitors; we may not be successful in commercializing our cloud-based distribution model; our products may not perform as expected; the results of our clinical studies may not support the use of our tests, particularly in the average-risk pregnancy population or for microdeletions screening, or may not be able to be replicated in later studies required for regulatory approvals or clearances; if our sole CLIA-certified laboratory facility becomes inoperable, we will be unable to perform our tests and our business will be harmed; we rely on a limited number of suppliers or, in some cases, single suppliers, for some of our laboratory instruments and materials and may not be able to find replacements or immediately transition to alternative suppliers; if we are unable to successfully scale our operations, our business could suffer; the marketing, sale, and use of Panorama and our other products could result in substantial damages arising from product liability or professional liability claims that exceed our resources; we may be unable to expand third-party payer coverage and reimbursement for Panorama, Horizon and our other tests, and we may be required to refund reimbursements already received; third-party payers may withdraw coverage or provide lower levels of reimbursement due to changing policies, billing complexities or other factors, such as the increased focus by third-party payers on requiring that prior authorization be obtained prior to conducting a test; if the FDA were to begin actively regulating our tests, we could incur substantial costs and delays associated with trying to obtain premarket clearance or approval and incur costs associated with complying with post-market controls; litigation or other proceedings, resulting from either third party claims of intellectual property infringement or third party infringement of our technology, is costly, time-consuming and could limit our ability to commercialize our products or services; and any inability to effectively protect our proprietary technology could harm our competitive position or our brand.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties that could affect our financial results are included under the captions, \"Risk Factors\" and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in our most recent filings on Forms 10-K and 10-Q and in other filings that we make with the SEC from time to time.
